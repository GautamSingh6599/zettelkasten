## 2nd Order Derivative

A function $f$ over an interval $J$ is twice differentiable at some $c \in J$ if $f$ is differentiable in $(c - \delta, c + \delta) \cap J$ for some $\delta>0$ and the function $f':(c-\delta, c+\delta)\cap J \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $c$. We denote the second order derivatives as $f''$.

## nth Order Derivatives

A function $f$ over an interval $J$ is said to be $n$ times differentiable at some $c \in J$ if $f^{n-1}$ exists on $(c- \delta, c+\delta)\cap J$ for some $\delta > 0$ and $f^{n-1}:(c-\delta, c+\delta)\cap J$ is  differentiable at $c$.

A function $f$ is *smooth* and *infinitely differentiable* if $f^{n}$ exists for all $n \in mathbb{N}$.
