## Local Minima

For a function $f$ defined over an interval $J$ a point $c \in J$ is a *point of local minima* if there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
$$
f(c) \leq f(x) \quad \forall x \in (c - \delta, c + \delta)\cap J 
$$
Points of local maxima can be similarly constructed.

## Global Minima

A *global minima* for a function defined over an interval $J$ is some point $c \in J$ for which the following is true
$$
f(c) \leq f(x) \quad \forall x \in J 
$$
A *global maxima*  can be similarly constructed.

A global minima might not be a local minima. For example,

## Theorem 1

Suppose $c \in J$ is a point of local minima for a [[differentiable functions|differentiable]] function $f$ defined on $J$. Then 
$$
f'(c) = 0
$$
However, for a global minima the derivative need not vanish.
