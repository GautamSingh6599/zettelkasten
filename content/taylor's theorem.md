## Taylor's Theorem

Suppose $f$ is function on $[a, b]$ such that $f^{(n)}$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $f^{(n + 1)}$ exists on $(a, b)$. Then for any $x, x_{0} \in [a, b]$ such that $x \neq x_{0}$ there exists $c$ between $x$ and $x_{0}$ such that the following holds true $$
f(x) = f(x_{0}) + \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{n + 1}f^{(k)}(x_{0})\frac{(x - x_{0})^{k}}{k!}
$$
