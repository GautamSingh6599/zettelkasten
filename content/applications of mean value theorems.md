## Theorem 1

Suppose $f$ is a differentiable function over the interval $J$ such that $$
f'(x) = 0 \quad \forall x \in J.
$$
Then $f$ is a constant function.

## Theorem 2

Suppose $f$ is differentiable over an interval $J$ such that $$
f'(x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x \in J.
$$
Then $f$ is increasing on the interval $J$.

## Theorem 3

Suppose $f$ is differentiable over an interval $J$ such that
$$
f'(x) \leq M \quad \forall x \in J
$$
for some $M \geq 0$ then $f$ is [[Lipschitz continuous]].
