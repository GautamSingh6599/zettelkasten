# Inverse Function Theorem

Assume that $f$ is continuously differentiable over $(a, b)$ such that $f'(x) \neq 0 \quad \forall x \in (a, b)$. Then $f$ is strictly monotone and $f((a, b))$ is an interval.
Also $f^{-1}$ exists satisfying $$
(f^{-1})'(y) = \frac{1}{f^{-1}(f(y))} \quad \forall y \in f((a, b))
$$
