# Schrödinger Equation

The *Schrödinger Equation* can be solved to find the [[wave-function]] of any particle for suitable initial conditions. For example, the 1-D Schrodinger Equation is 

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \,\Psi}{\partial \, t}  = -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{\partial^{2} \, \Psi}{\partial^{2} \, x^{2}} + V \, \Psi
$$
